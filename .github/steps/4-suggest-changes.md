# Step 4: Organize with Categories 🗂️

## 📌 Objective  
Understand how to organize your discussions with categories so others can easily find, navigate, and contribute to relevant conversations.

## 🧠 Why It Matters  
Well-organized discussions help your team:
- Navigate ideas faster
- Separate feedback from feature requests
- Keep the conversation flowing in the right places

## 🚀 Your Task  

You have two options to complete this step:

**Option A (if you have admin/moderator access):**
1. Go to the **"Discussions"** tab.
2. Open **Settings > Manage Categories**.
3. Add a new category (e.g. “Announcements,” “UX Feedback”).

**Option B (for all users):**
1. Go to any discussion.
2. Click **Edit discussion**.
3. Change its category (e.g. move it from “Q&A” to “Ideas”).

Either action will trigger the final step and complete your GitHub Skill journey!
