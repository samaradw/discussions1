# Step 2: Reply and Upvote 💬👍

## 📌 Objective  
Practice engaging with other users by replying to discussions and upvoting helpful comments.

## 🧠 Why It Matters  
Strong communities aren’t just about asking questions—they’re about helping others and showing appreciation. Replying and reacting helps:
- Encourage thoughtful contributions
- Boost visibility of helpful answers
- Create a more positive, interactive community

## 🚀 Your Task  
1. Find an existing discussion (or use your own).
2. Add a reply to it—share your thoughts or answer a question.
3. Add a 👍 (thumbs up) reaction to **any** comment in that discussion.

Once you've done both, the next step will unlock automatically!

✅ When both actions are detected, you'll move on to **Step 3**.
