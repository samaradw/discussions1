## 💡 Real-World Use Case  
Maintainers of large open-source projects like [Microsoft’s VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/discussions) use Discussions to:
- Triage community ideas
- Support users outside of issues
- Build a knowledge base over time

You can now do the same — for your open-source project, team repo, or even classroom!
